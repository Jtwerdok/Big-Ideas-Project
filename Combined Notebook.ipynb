    "Everyone loves a good stroll, including the members of the Walking Group.  Therefore, our group decided to equate \"bestness\" to \"walkability\" and explore datasets that capture the walkability of neighborhoods around Pittsburgh. Based on our experience walking around Pittsburgh, we agreed that not all neighborhoods are created equal when it comes to their walkability, and that this would probably be reflected in the datasets we chose to explore, making it a worthwhile and interesting lens through which to view our city."

I would say that that this does not sway my opinion, and I would also say that, based on my crosswalk submetric, where it appears second, South Side Flats is a still a very walkable neighborhood.  I will have to walk around Squirrel Hill South to get a better comparison; this is definitely giving me incentive to do so."

South Oakland and Squirrel Hill did not appear near the top of my list but they still had ratios larger than 1, so they aren't terrible by any means.
