Therefore, our group decided to equate \"bestness\" to \"walkability\" and explore datasets that capture the walkability of neighborhoods around Pittsburgh. Based on our experience walking around Pittsburgh, we realized that not all neighborhoods are created equal when it comes to their walkability, and that this would probably be reflected in the datasets we chose to explore, making it a worthwhile and interesting lens through which to our city."
