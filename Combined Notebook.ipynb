    "Everyone loves a good stroll, including the members of the Walking Group.  Therefore, our group decided to equate \"bestness\" to \"walkability\" and explore datasets that capture the walkability of neighborhoods around Pittsburgh. Based on our experience walking around Pittsburgh, we agreed that not all neighborhoods are created equal when it comes to their walkability, and that this would probably be reflected in the datasets we chose to explore, making it a worthwhile and interesting lens through which to view our city."

We considered several valid submetrics while forming our approach to determining the best/most walkable neighborhood in the city: walking safety, number of speed bumps in a neighborhood, the walk score of a neighborhood, and crosswalk availability per neighborhood."

I would say that that this does not sway my opinion, and I would also say that, based on my crosswalk submetric, where it appears second, South Side Flats is a still a very walkable neighborhood.  I will have to walk around Squirrel Hill South to get a better comparison; this is definitely giving me incentive to do so."

There were 3 communities, Overbrook, Stanton Heights, and Central Oakland tied for the lowest number of speed humps in any Pittsburgh neighborhood. These neighborhoods only had one speed hump. Squirrel Hill was the only neighborhood in my top three that appeared in our final top 5 safest neighborhoods to walk in. "
